            <p>A web page (or webpage) is a Web document that is accessed in a web browser.[1] A website typically consists of many web pages linked together under a common domain name.</br>
                 The term "web page" is therefore a metaphor of paper pages bound together into a book.</p>
            <p>
                Each web page is identified by a distinct Uniform Resource Locator (URL).</br>
                 When the user inputs a URL into their web browser, the browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then transforms it into an interactive visual representation on the user's screen.[2]
